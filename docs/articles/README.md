    *Abstract*

    The lack of legitimate datasets on mobile money transactions to perform research on in the domain of fraud detection is a big problem today in the scientific community. Part of the problem is the intrinsic private nature of financial transactions, that leads to no public available data sets.

    This will leave the researchers with the burden of first harnessing the dataset before performing the actual research on it. This paper propose an approach to such a problem that we named the PaySim simulator. PaySim is a financial simulator that simulates mobile money transactions based on an original dataset. In this paper, we present a solution to ultimately yield the possibility to simulate mobile money transactions in such away that they become similar to the original dataset. With technology frameworks such as Agent-Based simulation techniques, and the application of mathematical statistics,we show in this paper that the simulated data can be as prudent as the original dataset for research.
