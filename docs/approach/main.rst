Online Learning at Cost
#######################

Problem definition
------------------
Prevent model decay, due to dynamic data, over time under resource constraints.
Data can change over time and collecting information on these changes is costly.

What do we want to communicate
------------------------------

Presentation medium
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Jupyter notebook slides

Demonstration of the problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Graphs:
#. Demonstration of dynamic data
#. Linked to the data show model performance
#. Cost of relabelling all new data points under the constraint of a budget.

How does the data represent the characteristics and issue that arise from those characteristics.


Data characteristics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mapping between toy problem and real-life use-case.

Use-case:

#. Malware detection
#. Intrusion detection
#. Financial fraud where the type of fraud is non-static
#. Predictive maintenance with exogenous influences/factors
#. Sentiment links to vocabulary



**Potential issues**
- Scope creep - The problem space is big enough that it could fill multiple PHDs so we should be careful to prevent digging in to much in a particular step given the allotted time.

  1. By strongly scoping the problem space beforehand and solidifying this in a set of assumptions we can prevent creep.

- Circular dependencies - The way the subsections of the problem are intertwined could cause circular dependencies in the work, where the project members are dependent on work of others.

  1. This will be addressed by creating a minimal viable pipeline between the various elements which will reduces the chance of blockages.

- Due to scope and
